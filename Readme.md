# node-ddate

Utility to convert dates to the Discordian calendar.

## Features

- No dependencies.
- Can be require()d as a library
- Can be used from the command-line as a (almost) drop-in replacement for the ddate utility found in util-linux.
This is really good for systems like windows where building such things is a pain.
- Converts aneristic dates into Discordian ones, probably correctly
- Written in the spirit of the original ddate utility!

## Installation

for use as a library:

    $ npm install ddate

or for use from the command line:

    $ npm install -g ddate

## Usage

tbd.

## Known Issues

For now it can only handle dates after UNIX epoch. Will fix eventually.
