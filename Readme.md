# node-ddate

Utility to convert dates to the Discordian calendar.

## Features

    - Can be require()d as a library
    - Can be used from the command-line as a (almost) drop-in replacement for the ddate utility found in util-linux.
    This is really good for systems like windows where building such things is a pain.
    - Converts aneristic dates into Discordian ones
    - Written in the spirit of the original ddate utility!

## Installation

for use as a library:

    $ npm install ddate

or for use from the command line:

    $ npm install -g ddate

## Usage
